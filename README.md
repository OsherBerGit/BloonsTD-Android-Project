## 📖 About
This is my final **Android Development Project** submitted for high school graduation (5 units of Computer Science, 2023). 

It is a fully functional **2D Tower Defense game** inspired by the classic "Bloons TD". The goal is simple: prevent balloons from reaching the end of the path by strategically placing "monkey towers" that pop them. 

I built this project to master the fundamentals of mobile development, game loops, and object-oriented programming.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Language:** Java (Native Android)
* **IDE:** Android Studio
* **Database:** Firebase Realtime Database (Cloud Save/Load)
* **Minimum SDK:** API 21 (Android 5.0)

## ✨ Highlights & Features
* **🎮 Custom 2D Engine:** Hand-coded rendering logic for the game board, moving balloons, and projectiles.
* **☁️ Cloud Integration:** Uses **Firebase** to save player progress and high scores remotely.
* **👆 Drag & Drop System:** Custom touch listeners allowing smooth placement of towers on the map.
* **🧠 Dynamic Game Logic:** Economy (gold), wave progression, and life systems.
* **📱 Device Compatibility:** Originally built for older versions, now tested on modern devices like the **Pixel 7 Pro**.

## 🚀 Quick Start
To run this project:
1. **Clone the repo:** `git clone https://github.com/OsherBerGit/Bloons-Tower-Defense.git`
2. **Open in Android Studio** and let Gradle sync.
3. **Run** on an emulator or physical device.
