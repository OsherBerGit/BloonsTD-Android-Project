# Bloons Tower Defense - Android Project

This is my final Android development project from high school (5 units of Computer Science). It is a 2D Tower Defense game inspired by the classic "Bloons TD," developed as a learning journey into mobile app development and game logic.

## 📝 Project Overview
The game challenges players to prevent balloons (Bloons) from reaching the end of a path. Players strategically place "monkeys" (towers) along the path to pop the balloons. Popping balloons earns currency, which can be used to purchase more defenses.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **2D Graphics Engine:** Real-time rendering of game board, towers, and balloon waves.
* **Game Logic:** Implements tower defense mechanics, including life systems, economy (gold), and progressive wave difficulty.
* **Firebase Integration:** Users can save their game progress to the cloud and resume later.
* **Drag & Drop Interface:** Interactive UI for placing towers on the game map.
* **Instructional System:** Built-in guide for new players to understand game mechanics.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Language:** Java / Kotlin (Android)
* **Database:** Firebase Realtime Database (for saving game states)
* **Minimum SDK:** API 21 (Android 4.4.3)
* **Tools:** Android Studio

## 📱 Tested On
* Pixel 7 Pro (Physical & Emulator)
* Android versions 4.4.3 through 5.0.1

## 💡 What I Learned
During this project, I gained hands-on experience with:
1.  **Mobile Game Loops:** Managing real-time movement and collision detection.
2.  **State Management:** Handling game data and syncing it with a remote database.
3.  **UI/UX Design:** Creating a responsive drag-and-drop system for mobile screens.
4.  **Problem Solving:** Translating complex game rules into working code.
